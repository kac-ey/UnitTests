# CS320UnitTests

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Each project will have a list of requirements that determines what functions the program needs to be considered successful. Writing and testing code against these requirements to ensure code includes all the specifications assures that the program is fully functional. Code coverage provides an additional confirmation that every function contained within the code is addressed in unit tests.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The list of requirements for a project also aids in providing guidelines of user needs that should be incorporated into a program. Developers and testers should consider how these requirements work together to create the user experience. This requires common sense, deductive reasoning, experience, and attention to detail.


How do I approach designing software?

Software design should be approached methodically and deliberately, with testing processes in mind. If software is developed taking into account testing processes, it reduces the complexity of testing in the future. Comments explaining the interdependency of methods, functions, and other components should be present to aid testers inunderstanding how the program functions as a whole, since that is the main focus of testers.
